# hello-world
This is my own intro repository

This is the hello world tutorial on github that I am using.
I now started a second tutorial trying to make sure I understand the entire process.

This is a great training tool.

I continue to try and learn this automation thing.  Still working out how all this git cloning and branching stuff works.  Slowly getting it as it takes time in between production work.

This is another line of text in the readme file that I created as I try to learn this stuff.

Today is June 18, 2019 and I am adding another line of text to the read me file.
